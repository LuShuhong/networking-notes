# Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): An Overview

VPC is a service that lets users provision a logically isolated section of the cloud where resources can be launched in a defined virtual network.

## What is a VPC?

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is an on-demand configurable pool of shared resources allocated within a public cloud environment, providing a certain level of isolation between the different organizations (denoted as users hereafter) using the resources.

## Key Features of VPC

### 1. **Isolation and Security**:

VPCs allow for better security and network isolation. Users can leverage security groups and network access control lists to filter inbound and outbound traffic.

### 2. **Custom IP Range**:

With VPC, users can select their own IP address range, create subnets, and configure route tables.

### 3. **Internet Connectivity**:

Resources in a VPC can be easily connected to the internet via an internet gateway.

### 4. **Connectivity Across VPCs**:

VPC peering allows for communication between different VPCs, both within the same cloud provider or across providers.

### 5. **Hybrid Cloud Capabilities**:

Many enterprises use VPC to connect to their on-premises data center, creating a hybrid cloud environment.

## Why Use VPC?

Organizations turn to VPCs to ensure a higher level of security and isolation for their cloud-based applications. It grants them the flexibility to design their virtual networking environment as if they were operating their own data center, but without the associated costs of physical hardware.
